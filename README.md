# Project Repository

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project, which includes two key submodules: the Power submodule and the Sensing submodule.
This repository serves as a central hub for managing and sharing all the relevant files, including datasheets, schematics, and code associated with each submodule.

## Submodules

### Power Submodule
The Power submodule is responsible for supplying the necessary electrical power to all components of the project. 
It ensures that all components are properly powered under different operational conditions.

### Sensing Submodule
The Sensing submodule deals with acquiring data from the physical environment through sensors.

## Repository Contents

- **Datasheets** - Contains all the technical datasheets for components used in both submodules. This includes information on specifications, usage, and limitations of components such as sensors and power management chips.

- **Schematics** - Provides detailed schematics for the design and layout of the electrical circuits used in the project. This includes diagrams for both the Power and Sensing submodules.

- **Docs** - Documentation related to the project, including setup guides, usage instructions, and development notes.
- **Gerber Files** - KiCad Gerber files for each subsection.
  
## Additional Resources
